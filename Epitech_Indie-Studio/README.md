## A project created during our second year at Epitech.
The aim of this project was to create a cross-platform 3D [Bomberman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Bomberman "Direct Inspiration") while being limited to only using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.

Since the raylib library is purely written in C, the challenge of this project was to encapsulate all the required raylib functions in our own classes.

In Addition to implementing the Neo Bomberman gameplay, we also had to implemented fully-featured settings and save-states.
