# Unity 3D Workshop

This was a voluntary workshop I organized during my studies at Epitech.

It was designed to help my fellow students learn the basics of Unity 3D within three hours.
During the workshop I handed out the included .pdf task sheet and helped all participants with it's completion.

After the workshop was over, I sent my 'solution' project to all participants as an example.
